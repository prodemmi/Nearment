# 🧠 Semantic Comment Search Demo 
Nearment (Near + Comment) is **a** full-stack demo using **React**, **Express**, **Qdrant**, and **Cassandra** for semantic search over user comments. Designed for product comment analysis and searching.

## ✨ Features
- 💬 Submit comments with auto-detected **sentiment purpose**
- 🔍 Find similar comments using **vector similarity**
- 🔧 Filter by product or sentiment category (good/bad)
- ⚡ Fast Qdrant-based semantic retrieval

## 📡 API Documentation
### 📌 POST /comments
Submit a new comment, analyze its sentiment & purpose, generate vector, and store it in both Cassandra and Qdrant.

🔸 Request Body
```json
{
  "text": "The product was fake and the box was damaged.",
  "product_id": "5"
}
```
### 📌 GET /same.subject
Find comments related to a conceptual subject (e.g. "bad", "good") based on front-end filters for a specific product.

🔸 Query Params
| Name         | Type   | Required | Description                                      |
| ------------ | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `subject`    | string | ✅        | Semantic subject key (e.g., `"bad"` or `"good"`) |
| `product_id` | string | ✅        | Target product ID                                |

🔸 Response
```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 120, // comment id
      "text": "The product was clearly fake."
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

### 📌 GET /same.comments/:id
Find similar comments based on the semantic vector of a specific comment.

🔸 URL Params
| Name | Type   | Required | Description                 |
| ---- | ------ | -------- | --------------------------- |
| `id` | string | ✅        | ID of the reference comment |

🔸 Example

```
GET /same.comments/:comment-id
```

🔸 Response
```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 80,
      "text": "Really poor packaging and fake product."
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

### 📌 Notes
- Vectors are generated using **@huggingface/transformers** based on the purpose of each comment.

- Qdrant is used for semantic similarity search.

- Cassandra stores raw comment data and metadata.

## 🧠 Purpose Detection Format
Each comment is analyzed to extract:
```json
// Example comment text: "This product is clearly fake. The box was crushed and the quality is awful. I really regret buying it — terrible experience overall."
{
  "score": -7, // Between -10 and +10, 0 for Neutral
  "comparative": -0.43, // Score / total word count
  "purpose": "The product was fake, the packaging was damaged, I had a bad experience, I regretted the purchase, the quality was poor."
}
```
Only the purpose is vectorized and stored in Qdrant.
